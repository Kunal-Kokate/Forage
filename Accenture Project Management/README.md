## Four different project management approaches Summed Up
*Full definitions of each style can be found [here](https://github.com/Kunal-Kokate/Forage/blob/main/Accenture%20Project%20Management/Accenture%20Project%20Management%20Approaches.pdf)*

**1. Plan Driven Project Management**
- This traditional method involves planning all project details—scope, costs, schedule, and resources—thoroughly at the start. The goal is to minimize changes and errors by having a clear plan. It's important to control costs, resource use, schedules, quality, and meet stakeholder expectations. 

**2. Agile Project Management**
- Agile focuses on being flexible and adapting to changes throughout the project. It involves short cycles of work (like sprints) where the team delivers parts of the project, gathers feedback, and adjusts accordingly. The aim is to continuously improve and respond quickly to new information or changes. 

**3. Second Agile Project Management**
- This approach is similar to Agile but is adapted for larger organizations with multiple teams. It requires more coordination and communication across teams to achieve common goals. Teams work in sync, often planning in advance and meeting regularly to ensure alignment and address dependencies between teams.
 
**4. Hybrid Project Management**
- This method combines elements from different project management approaches. For example, a team might use Agile's short work cycles while also planning for the long term like in Plan Driven management. This allows teams to adapt methods based on the specific needs of a project


## Next Steps
- Your manager has sent you through some client projects and asked you to help them determine which project management approach is most appropriate.
- Open the [Which Project Mangement](https://github.com/Kunal-Kokate/Forage/blob/main/Accenture%20Project%20Management/Which%20Project%20Management.pdf) to read through the client scenarios and choose which project management works with each scenerario.
